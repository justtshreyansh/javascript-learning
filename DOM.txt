When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page


In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

Important method and elements

1.document.getElementById('title') -> select the element with id  =  title

2.document.getElementById('title').style.backgroundColor = '#414141'; -> style the background color to #414141

3.title.innerText -> it gives text which are visible.

4.title.textContent -> it gives the text which are not visible even if display none property is applied.

5.title.innerHTML -> it gives the whole html between the starting and ending tag. (span tag bhi de deta hai ye)

6.document.querySelector('h1') -> it gives the first html element with h1 tag

7.document.querySelectorAll('h1') -> it gives all the html element with h1 tag which is a node list
